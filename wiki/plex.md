# Plex Library Setup Guide

This assumes you have a **[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)** sever.

## Create a Library:

Create a plex library (**TV Series**) for Floatplane and set these settings for it:<br>
**Make sure you follow these instructions exactly.**

### Posters:

There is a collection of posters you can download, you can find them **[Here](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-Downloader/tree/master/artwork)**.<br>
Use these to set the artwork for each channel in plex if you dont want it to be blank.

### Enable Library Refresh

If you want plex to automatically update as soon as new videos are downloaded you can add your Floatplane library to the plex section of your settings.json...<br>
The easiest way to do this is by setting `runQuickStartPrompts` to **true** and following the prompts to login and setup plex library refreshing.<br>

<br>
If however you want to manually configure it directly in your settings you should end up with something like this:<br>

More details can be found on the specific settings at the **[Settings Wiki](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-Downloader/blob/master/wiki/settings.md)**

### Optional Plex Addon (Open Folder/Play in MediaPlayer):

If you dont want to watch the Floatplane content in the plex player and just want to use it for browsing the library. Then you can install **[This Awesome Script](https://github.com/Kayomani/PlexExternalPlayer)** to let you open the folder media is in and auto play plex files in your default media player.

More info on its install is at the above link.<br>
