Note that this only works for videos that are sorted using title matching for channels. Newer channel id matching will not remove any prefix.  
For example:  
`TechLinked - SXXEXX - VideoTitle` - **true**  
vs  
`TechLinked - SXXEXX - TL: VideoTitle` - **false**

```json
"extras": {
    "stripSubchannelPrefix": true
}
```

<br>

**extras.downloadArtwork**:

Saves video metadata to nfo files alongside each video.

```json

    "safeNfo": true
}
```

<br>

**extras.considerAllNonPartialDownloaded**:  
When this is set to true the downloader will skip size checks for non `.mp4` files.  
This may result in files without muxed metadata and should only be used for recovery if your `db` is lost.

```json
"extras": {
    "considerAllNonPartialDownloaded": true
}
```

<br>

            "server": "ServerA",
            "section": "Floatplane"
        },
        {
            "server": "ServerB",
            "section": "Floatplane"
        }
    ]
}
```

<br>

**plex.token**:  
Plex token generated from your login details for updating remote servers.

```

<br>

## Subscriptions:

All the Floatplane creators you are subscribed to.  
![image](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-Downloader/assets/6373693/9535456d-158a-4ead-b355-8d3155a8d979)
At the creator level you can see the `creatorId` and `plan`. You can also choose to `skip` a creator and not download videos from them.  
You can add custom channels to a creator if you want.
<br>

First come first served, the first channel a video matches to is what it goes into, channels are checked top to bottom in the config. Videos cannot be sorted into multiple channels.
<br>

A **channel** is made up of a `title`, `skip`, `isChannel` and optionally `daysToKeepVideos`.  
`title` is the nice name used for the channel.  
`skip` can be set to true to skip downloading videos matched on the given channel.  
`isChannel` function that returns true or false if the video should be sorted into this channel (more on this further down).  
`daysToKeepVideos` is the optional number of days to keep videos for this channel. **2** would mean only videos released within the **last two days** are downloaded and any older will be **automatically deleted** if previously downloaded.

<br>

**isChannel** is a function that accepts a **[post](https://jman012.github.io/FloatplaneAPIDocs/Redoc/redoc-static.html#tag/ContentV3/operation/getBlogPost)** which is the post the video belongs to and **[video](https://jman012.github.io/FloatplaneAPIDocs/Redoc/redoc-static.html#tag/ContentV3/operation/getVideoContent)** which is one or more videos belonging to that post.

If it returns **true** the video is sorted into the channel, **false** and its not.
This gives the flexibility to create completely custom channels based on any properties of a post or video.
<br>

For example:

```json
{
	"title": "Creators with Technology in their Description",
	"skip": false,
	"isChannel": "(post, video) => post.creator?.description?.toLowercase()?.includes('technology')",
	"daysToKeepVideos": 5
}
```

<br>

## Metrics:

**metrics.prometheusExporterPort**:  
Default is `null` if set to a number prometheus metrics will be made availible at that port.

```json
"metrics": {
    "prometheusExporterPort": 8080,
}
```

<br>

**metrics.contributeMetrics**:  
If true metrics will be included in the aggregate dashboard.

```json
"metrics": {
    "contributeMetrics": true
}
```
