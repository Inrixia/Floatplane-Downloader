## Subscriptions:

All the Floatplane creators you are subscribed to.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6373693/115116013-86a4a480-9feb-11eb-828a-fe4fa8ba5cf9.png)<br>
At the creator level you can see the `creatorId` and `plan`. You can also choose to `skip` a creator and not download videos from them.<br>
<br>

All creators will have a `_default` channel, this is what videos are sorted under by default if there are no other channels that match.<br>
You can add as many channels to a creator as you like, each **channel** has its own episode count and is considered its own "series".<br>
<br>

A **channel** is made up of a `title`, `skip`, an array of `identifiers` and `consoleColor`.<br>
`title` is the nice name used for the channel.<br>
`skip` can be set to true to skip downloading videos matched on the given channel.<br>
`identifiers` specify the conditions for a video to be added to a channel.<br>
`consoleColor` is optional and is used for having colors in console output for seperate channels.<br>
<br>

An Identifier contains two entries `check` and `type`.<br>
`check` is the string to look for.<br>
`type` is where in the video returned from the floatplane api to search for the check string.<br>
<br>

For example:

```json
"Floatplane Exclusive": {
    "title": "Floatplane Exclusive",
    "skip": false,
    "identifiers": [
        {
            "check": "FP Exclusive: ",
            "type": "title"
        }
    ],
    "consoleColor": "\u001b[38;5;200m"
}
```

This is a channel named "Floatplane Exclusive".<br>
Videos that have "FP Exclusive: " in their title will be sorted into this channel.<br>
<br>

A few more notes regarding channels:<br>

- First come first served, the first channel a video matches to is what it goes into, channels are checked top to bottom in the config. Videos cannot be sorted into multiple channels.
- You can have multiple identifiers per channel to allow for more accurate matching.
- The `check` string is removed from the video's title if the `type`is equal to "title".
